<p>Hello, I have created a basic custom API like Razorpay that accepts card payments</p>
<b>The Requirements are:</b>
<ul>
  <li>Installation of Node.JS</li>
  <li>After Installation of Node.JS, from terminal, run the command npm init for the initial setup</li>
  <li>Install express and nodemon using npm and save the updated package.json file by including "start": "nodemon server.js" inside scripts{}</li>
  <li>For the timebeing, I have used the Postman App to test this app. Install this app with a version specific to your system. Open the app and create a new blank collection, and add the post request to localhost:8000, with the body containing an object of the following properties: "name", "number", "cvv", "amt" and put your values and send the request. The output will be displayed in the console (the terminal)</li>
</ul>
